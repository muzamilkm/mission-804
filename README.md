# Mission 804


Mission 804 is an AI-powered, maze-like prison escape game where the player must navigate a complex, ever-changing environment to escape. The game features intelligent agents and uses pathfinding algorithms, such as A*, for initial navigation and reinforcement learning for dynamic agent behavior.

The game's goal is to escape the maze while avoiding detection and overcoming various obstacles. It uses a unique combination of AI techniques to challenge the player and provide an engaging experience, including:

A* Pathfinding Algorithm: For both the hero and enemy agents.
Reinforcement Learning: To allow the hero agent to adapt and find the best path while avoiding guards and obstacles.
Real-Time Agent Movement: Guards, walls, and obstacles are simulated, requiring the hero to continuously adapt.
This project is built using Pygame and provides a visually rich environment, showcasing the interactions between intelligent agents in a prison scenario.
